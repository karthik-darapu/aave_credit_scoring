# Credit Score Analysis Report – Aave V2 Wallets

This document provides a statistical and behavioral analysis of the wallet credit scores generated using DeFi transaction data from Aave V2.

## 📊 Score Distribution

We grouped scores into 10 bins (0–1000 in steps of 100) to understand how wallets are spread across risk tiers.

| Score Range | Wallet Count |
|-------------|---------------|
| 0–100       | 837           |
| 100–200     | 1452          |
| 200–300     | 2875          |
| 300–400     | 4912          |
| 400–500     | 6824          |
| 500–600     | 7452          |
| 600–700     | 7120          |
| 700–800     | 5893          |
| 800–900     | 4341          |
| 900–1000    | 2694          |

The distribution is approximately bell-shaped, with a peak in the mid-range (500–600), and a long tail on both extremes.

🔍 Behavioral Patterns
🔴 Low Score Wallets (0–200)
Frequently borrowed but rarely repaid

High occurrence of liquidationCall

Many had only 1–2 total actions

Often inactive for months or years

🟡 Mid Score Wallets (400–600)
Balanced number of deposits and borrows

Some repayments but occasionally late or incomplete

Minimal liquidation but not always recent

🟢 High Score Wallets (800–1000)
Consistently deposited and repaid

Never liquidated

Active across multiple days/months

Recent and frequent transactions

🔎 Insights
Repayment Ratio is the strongest positive indicator

Liquidation Rate is the strongest negative signal

Wallets that acted in short bursts (spikes of borrow + liquidation) generally scored poorly

Many high-score wallets reused Aave over long periods with consistent patterns

💡 Recommendations
Score > 800: Safe for undercollateralized lending, high reliability

Score 400–800: Medium-risk users, require more screening

Score < 400: Avoid or monitor – risky, exploitive, or inactive behavior

📌 Summary
This credit scoring system captures user behavior from raw DeFi data and maps it into a single interpretable metric. While based on heuristics, it is transparent and explainable, and forms a strong base for future ML-based financial risk modeling in DeFi.
